# Arduino-TTGO-Watch

This repository is for those who want to program their TTGO-Watch with the Arduino IDE. I agree that using platformio greatly expands the possibilities for programming, but I also agree that mastering this tool (platformio) is not an easy task.
All code is intended to be used with the Arduino IDE.

Starter sample: \examples\LVGL\SimpleWatch from repository: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library
To set up the Arduino IDE, follow the instructions from the above repository.

I prefer the seven-segment font, so I added it. You can skip using it if you don't like it.

Likewise, touch control performance with LVGL is not very good. Therefore, the control is transformed for greater convenience.

The code is still far from perfect, but you can test it now.

I am not a professional programmer, this is just my hobby, I apologize to the professionals for my amateurish approach to some programming issues.
